            <h1>Hi, My name is<span> Dexter Babao</span> an IT Student</h1>
            <p>Before I wanted to be an IT student everything started 
                on Online games. From the time I start playing online 
                games, I think that I want to be a computer expert someday.
                <br><br>
                Then i begin to study computer by taking the ICT strand when im in
                Senior High to improve my computer skills. For 2 years of studying 
                i learned the basic of html and javascript coding. I also learn the basic 
                of using photoshop that can be used for photo editing.
                <br><br>
                After graduating Senior High i take the BSIT course to continue my study on 
                computer. For 3 years of studying on DLL, my skills become better. I learned 
                the advance features for java and html coding, i also learned the other 
                program language that can be used for web design and game function. The 
                most interesting part is i learned the cybersecurity which give me a 
                knowledge about hacking.The knowledge that i have proved that i am an 
                IT student
